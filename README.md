# Ham Radio Simulator  

## Overview  
The **Ham Radio Simulator** is an engaging educational tool designed for beginners and hobbyists interested in amateur radio communication. By simulating ham radio operations, the app allows users to learn Morse code (CW), practice tuning, and interact with simulated or real-world signals—all without needing physical equipment or a ham radio operator license.  

## Key Features  

### Morse Code Practice  
- **Straight Key Input:** Simulate tapping a Morse code "straight key" using a keyboard or mouse.  
- **Paddle Input:** Option to simulate "paddle" devices for automatic dits and dahs.  

### Radio Tuning and Signal Reception  
- **Frequency Control:** Tune to frequencies for different simulated radio bands. 
- **Band Pass Filter:** Adjustable filter width to control incoming signal clarity.
 - **Audio Low Pass Filter:** Adjustable low pass filter to filter out noise and higher frequencies. 
- **Signal Pitch and Volume:** Mimic real-world effects of mismatched frequencies.  

### Multi-Player Operation  
- Connect with other users in real time.  
- Exchange encoded messages on different frequencies.  
- Chat server implementation for smooth message relays.  

### Single-Player Training  
- **Beginner Mode:** Practice copying individual letters, call signs, and common abbreviations.  
- **Scenarios:** Take part in scripted missions like disaster recovery or "summits on the air."  
- **AI Interaction:** Engage with AI agents simulating real-world radio conversations.  

### Advanced Features  
- **Noise and Interference Simulation:** Mimic challenging real-world radio conditions.  
- **Speed Control:** Adjust playback speed for incoming Morse signals to improve listening skills.  

### Scenario Builder  
- Create custom training scenarios for personalized learning or group challenges.  
- Save and share scenario files with others.  

## Why Use This Simulator?  
- No hardware required—perfect for beginners and educators.  
- Fun and engaging gameplay mechanics tied to real-world ham radio operations.  
- Adjustable learning curve, from beginner-friendly modes to advanced challenges.
